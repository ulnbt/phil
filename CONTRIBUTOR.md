# Contributor Guide

This project is a terminal-first symbolic calculator (`phil`) built on SymPy.
Changes should improve correctness, safety, and practical UX for math workflows.

## Development Setup

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest
uv run phil '2+2'
uv run phil
```

## Testing Strategy (Required)

Run these before pushing:

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest
uv run --group dev pytest --cov=calc --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90
scripts/fuzz.sh
scripts/security_audit.sh
# or
scripts/checks.sh
```

Test categories:

- `unit`: pure behavior of parser/evaluator/format helpers.
- `integration`: process-level CLI/REPL behavior.
- `regression`: fixed bug cases that must never regress.

Property tests (`hypothesis`) are used for high-value invariants in numeric/symbolic behavior.
Default local runs use a lighter profile for speed; use `HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE=ci` for CI-intensity checks and `HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE=fuzz` for deeper local fuzz runs.

Fast local loops:

```bash
# skip process-heavy integration tests while iterating
uv run --group dev pytest -m "not integration"
```

## Perfect Commit Standard

Adopt a "perfect commit" bar:

1. One logical change per commit.
2. Commit is releasable on its own (no broken intermediate states).
3. Tests accompany behavior changes.
4. Docs accompany user-facing changes.
5. Exclude unrelated cleanup from the same commit.

Before committing:

- Review staged diff only: `git diff --staged`
- Verify tests:
  - `uv run --group dev pytest`
  - `uv run --group dev pytest --cov=calc --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90`

Commit message guidance:

- Subject: imperative and specific, <=72 chars.
- Body: explain why, summarize what changed, note user impact.

## CI Expectations

CI runs:

- tests + coverage on Python `3.12` and `3.13`
- fuzz profile property tests on Python `3.12`
- dependency vulnerability audit via `pip-audit` on Python `3.12`
- install smoke test (`uv tool install .`, then run `phil`)

If your change adds behavior, add/adjust tests in the correct category.

## Release Process

Releases are automated through GitHub Actions + PyPI trusted publishing.

Before tagging, update release notes draft files:

- `release-notes/v0.3.0-draft.md`
- `release-notes/v0.4.0-draft.md`
- `release-notes/TEMPLATE.md` for future versions

Optional helper to print the final GitHub Release body for a draft:

```bash
scripts/release_notes.sh 0.3.0 --body
```

Create and push a tag:

```bash
git pull
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Or use the helper script:

```bash
scripts/release.sh 0.2.0
```

Then confirm:

- workflow success in GitHub Actions
- new version appears on PyPI (`philcalc`)
- GitHub Release notes match the current draft for that version

## Adding or Changing Math Operations

1. Add required import(s) in `src/calc/core.py`.
2. Expose user-facing entry in `LOCALS_DICT`.
3. Add tests in `tests/test_core.py` (and regression tests if bug-fix related).
4. Update `README.md` and `KNOWLEDGE.md` if user-visible.
5. Run full suite.

## Safety Rules

- Do not loosen parser globals in `GLOBAL_DICT`.
- Keep blocked-token and input-size protections unless there is a measured reason.
- Never execute user input outside SymPy parse/eval path.
- Keep growth guardrails intact for huge powers/towers/factorials; do not remove symbolic-first defer behavior.
- For new guardrails, preserve one-shot/REPL parity and keep errors in `E:` + `hint:` form.

## UX Rules

- Output remains terminal-first and script-friendly.
- Errors are concise: `E:` + actionable `hint:`.
- Keep REPL behavior consistent with one-shot mode (`--strict`, `--format`, `--no-simplify`).
- Ambiguous math input should prefer explicit guidance over silent guessing.

## Scope Guardrails

Avoid unnecessary complexity:

- plugin systems
- unrelated persistence layers
- large configuration frameworks

When adding complexity, explain the user value and testing impact in the PR.
